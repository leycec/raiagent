#FIXME: C:DDA ships with an undocumented and currently unsupported
#"CMakeLists.txt" for building under cmake. Switch to this makefile when
#confirmed to be reliably working.
#FIXME: After switching to cmake, remove the "pch? ( || ( ncurses sdl ) )"
#restriction below. Indeed, the inapplicability of that restriction to cmake is
#one of the strongest arguments in favour of switching to cmake.

# attempt to reuse precompiled headers unique to the ncurses binary when
# compiling the SDL binary, resulting in compilation errors resembling:
