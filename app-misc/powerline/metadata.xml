Powerline is a statusline plugin for vim, and provides statuslines and prompts
for several other applications, including zsh, bash, tmux, IPython, Awesome and
Qtile.

Features include:

* Extensible and feature rich, written in Python. Powerline was completely
  rewritten in Python to get rid of as much vimscript as possible. This has
  allowed much better extensibility, leaner and better config files, and a
  structured, object-oriented codebase with no mandatory third-party dependencies
  other than a Python interpreter.
* Stable and testable code base. Using Python has allowed unit testing of all
  the project code. The code is tested to work in Python 2.6+ and Python 3.
* Support for prompts and statuslines in many applications. Originally created
  exclusively for vim statuslines, the project has evolved to provide statuslines
  in tmux and several WMs, and prompts for shells like bash/zsh and other
  applications. It's simple to write renderers for any other applications that
  Powerline doesn't yet support.
* Configuration and colorschemes written in JSON. JSON is a standardized, simple
  and easy to use file format that allows for easy user configuration across all
  of Powerline's supported applications.
* Fast and lightweight, with daemon support for even better performance.
  Although the code base spans a couple of thousand lines of code with no goal of
  "less than X lines of code", the main focus is on good performance and as little
  code as possible while still providing a rich set of features. The new daemon
  also ensures that only one Python instance is launched for prompts and
  statuslines, which provides excellent performance.

But I hate Python / I don't need shell prompts / this is just too much hassle
for me / what happened to the original vim-powerline project / …

You should check out some of the Powerline derivatives. The most lightweight and
feature-rich alternative is currently Bailey Ling's vim-airline project.
